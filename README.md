# Hey curious Reader, my name is Rebecca! 


## Where I'm at:
- I am a **Junior Web Developer**, focused on the Frontend **(Javascript, React, Next)**, with basic knowledge of the Backend **(MongoDB, mongoose)**. 
- I am **very curious about** a deeper knowledge of the Backend (eg. **PHP**) and expanding my skills in the Frontend (**Typescript**).
- What **I love** about programming: you always **keep on learning** and you **keep on being challenged**! 


## Where I'm coming from:
- I finished my **A-levels** in Bavaria and went to live in **London for a year**, where I went to langauage school (**English, C2 Level**) and took care of three kids, which really helped me to **grow as a person** and taught me what it meant to take on a huge amount of **responsibility**.  
- I got my **Bachelors degree** in cultural studies, which taught me language skills (**Spanish, B2 Level**) and **scientific research and writing**.
- I went to live in **Málaga, Spain  for six months** during my years of study, which broadened my **language skills** and helped me to adapt to new surroundings and different cultures.
- I ended up working in the **social field for many years** in different areas, which skilled me in **team work**, appreciative **communication** and the importance of a **caring work environment**.
- AND THEN: I discovered my **passion for programming** and got a certificate after completing the **Web Development Bootcamp from NEUEFISCHE**.
- I, together with my teammate, developed **"TrailBlazer"**, an app for outdoor and adventure enthusiasts, wich contains the necessary **CRUD operations and responsive design** (have a look at our **repo** :) )


## Where I'm going:
- I am now **ready to bundle all my skills and get to work** in a new and exciting field!
- I am **super motivated** and open to learn **new things** and bring my **knowledge into practice**.
