## Hi everybody, my name is Rebecca! 

- I am a **Junior Web Developer**, focused on the Frontend **(JavaScript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS)**, with basic knowledge of the Backend **(Node.js, MongoDB)**. 
- I completed the **Web Development Bootcamp from NEUEFISCHE** end of Aug 2024.
- With my team, I developed **"TrailBlazer"**, an app for outdoor and adventure enthusiasts, wich contains the necessary **CRUD operations and responsive design** (have a look at our **repo** :) )
- I am **very curious about** a deeper knowledge of the Backend (eg. **PHP**) and expanding my skills in the Frontend (**Typescript**).

- What **I love** about programming: you always **keep on learning** and you **keep on being challenged**!
- I am **super motivated** to learn **new things** and put my **skills into practice**!
